theme_colourstrap
=================

Theme based off of Twitter Bootstrap but intended to restore COLOUR 
back to the desktop. Font based icons may be atractive to some, but 
until fonts can handle full colour they are simply a backwards step 
in my book.

English spelling of 'colour' is deliberate since this is the work of a mad Englishman
